# React Template
A simple React project for VoltBuilder apps.

VoltBuilder is a build service which generates Android and iOS executables from your React project.
There is no need to install Android Studio, Xcode, or to have a Mac.

This project is made using the [standard React Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).
After the tutorial is complete, you should have a dist folder in your project.
Copy the contents of that to the www folder in this project.

You can make native apps from ReactJS projects by doing the same thing.

Make sure the asset URLs in the built index.html file are relative (`./<path>`) - 
see the index.html file in the repo.

Feel free to use it as the basis for your project.
Consult the Apache Cordova documention for all of the features of Cordova.


## How to run

1. Download the project as a [zip file](https://github.com/voltbuilder/sample-react/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
1. [Upload to VoltBuilder](https://volt.build/upload/) using the Android option.

## iOS

iOS Signing requires developer specific files. This project just has placeholders for them.
You can generate signing files using [VoltSigner](https://voltsigner.com) if you have an Apple Developer account,
then add them to this project.
